		The Story
			On this day in 1890, an act of Congress creates Yosemite National Park, home of such natural wonders as Half Dome and the giant sequoia trees. Environmental trailblazer John Muir (1838-1914) and his colleagues campaigned for the congressional action, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison and paved the way for generations of hikers, campers and nature lovers, along with countless “Don’t Feed the Bears” signs

			The Culture
			Native Americans were the main residents of the Yosemite Valley, located in California’s Sierra Nevada mountain range, until the 1849 gold rush brought thousands of non-Indian miners and settlers to the region. Tourists and damage to Yosemite Valley’s ecosystem followed. In 1864, to ward off further commercial exploitation, conservationists convinced President Abraham Lincoln to declare Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias a public trust of California. This marked the first time the U.S. government protected land for public enjoyment and it laid the foundation for the establishment of the national and state park systems.

			Vsitor Centers 
			When planning a family vacation, a weekend get-away, or even just a Sunday drive, it often helps to know what you will encounter along the way and at your destination. This section will assist you in locating basic information for your trip, such as the visitor center hours, what sort of weather conditions you may experience, and the current conditions of park roads, trails, and other issues about which visitors may wish to know. If you wish to bring along a pet, the pet will limit where you can go and the activities in which you may participate. It's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with the Park Regulations so that you don't inadvertently break any laws. Certain activities—such as camping, building a beach fire, holding a special event, or commercial filming/photography—require permits and/or reservations.

			Where and How to go:
			Yosemite is beautiful and open year round, but before you decide to go. Check the listed links to be sure this is the right time for you to visit the park.
			You can drive to Yosemite all year and enter via Highways 41, 140, and 120 from the west. Tioga Pass Entrance (via Highway 120 from the east) is closed from around November through late May or June. Hetch Hetchy is open all year but may close intermittently due to snow. Please note that GPS units do not always provide accurate directions to or within Yosemite
