			Plants
			The native plants of Yosemite National Park are a significant part of the exquisite beauty and biological diversity of the park. The combination of climate, topography, moisture, and soils influence the distribution of plant communities across an elevation gradient from 1,800 feet (549 m) to over 13,000 feet (3,900 m). Vegetation zones range from scrub and chaparral communities at lower elevations, to subalpine forests and alpine meadows at the higher elevations.

			Animals
			Yosemite National Park supports more than 400 species of vertebrates including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. You might catch the eyes of an acorn woodpecker, a California ground squirrel, a bobcat, or a Western fence lizard. A human connection to animals, perhaps, entices our curiosity to be close to them, in part, by studying them.

			Birds
			In Yosemite, National Park when Bird watching the more sought-after birds include the: great gray owl, spotted owl, peregrine falcon, pileated woodpecker, and northern goshawk. Yosemite is habitat for over165 species of migrating, wintering, and breeding birds. Most regularly seen resident birds include: Steller's Jay, American Robin, Acorn Woodpecker, Common Raven, and Mountain Chickadee. In spring, look for the bright red wing patches on the Red-Winged Blackbird (most often seen in wet meadows) or the tropical looking Western Tanager flying about the conifers. Near rivers and streams, watch the American Dipper dart in and out of rapids and listen for their beautiful melodious song

			Fish
			Native fish are only found in the lower elevations of Yosemite. Native fish—including California roach, Sacramento pikeminnow, hardhead, and riffle sculpin—inhabit the lower reaches of the Merced River up to the vicinity of El Portal. Historic accounts suggest that rainbow trout and Sacramento suckers occurred as high as Yosemite Valley on the Merced River. Waterfalls prevented fish from migrating up the Tuolumne River into the Poopenaut and Hetch Hetchy valleys and up the South Fork of the Merced River to Wawona; therefore, the majority of waterbodies in what is now Yosemite were naturally fishless.

			 Wildflowers
			Yosemite is a wildflower enthusiast’s paradise, where blossoms are found most of the year. The park’s 11,000-foot range in elevation—from 2,000 feet on the west to 13,000 on the east—provides a phenomenal variety of growing conditions. Its location in the central Sierra Nevada makes it a crossroads for plant species that have migrated over the millennia from the Pacific coast, Great Basin, southern deserts, and northern mountains.
